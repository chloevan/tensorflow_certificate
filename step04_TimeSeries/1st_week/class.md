## Week 1 Quiz

1. What is an example of a Univariate time series? 

[x] Hour by hour temperature
[ ] Hour by hour weather  
[ ] Fashion items
[ ] Baseball scores

2. What is an example of a Multivariate time series? 

[ ] Fashion items
[ ] Hour by hour temperature 
[ ] Baseball scores
[x] Hour by hour weather

3. What is imputed data?

[ ] A good prediction of future data
[ ] A bad prediction of future data
[x] A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data
[ ] Data that has been withheld for various reasons

4. A sound wave is a good example of time series data

[ ] False
[x] True

5. What is Seasonality? 

[ ] Data that is only available at certain times of the year
[x] A regular change in shape of the data
[ ] Weather data
[ ] Data aligning to the 4 seasons of the calendar

6. What is a trend? incorrect

[ ] An overall consistent downward direction for data
[ ] An overall consistent flat direction for data
[ ] An overall consistent upward direction for data
[x] An overall direction for data regardless of direction

7. In the context of time series, what is noise?

[ ] Sound waves forming a time series
[ ] Data that doesn’t have a trend
[ ] Data that doesn’t have seasonality
[x] Unpredictable changes in time series data

8. What is autocorrelation?

[ ] Data that automatically lines up seasonally
[x] Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different
[ ] Data that automatically lines up in trends
[ ] Data that doesn’t have noise

9. What is a non-stationary time series?

[ ] One that moves seasonally
[ ] One that is consistent across all seasons
[x] One that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality
[ ] One that has a constructive event forming trend and seasonality

## Week 1 Wrap up
This week you explored the nature of time series data, and you saw some of the more common attributes of them, including things like seasonality and trend. You looked at some statistical methods for predicting time series data also.

Next week you're going to start to look into using DNNs for time series classification, including the important tasks of understanding how to break up a time series into training and validation data!

## Exercise 1 - Create and predict synthetic data
In the class you created a synthetic data series and performed a prediction on it using statistical methods. This notebook contains a different pattern. See if you can create a similar prediction for it to the one you did in class!

## Exercise 1 Answer- Create and predict synthetic data
Let's take a look at the solution
