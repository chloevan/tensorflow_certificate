## Exercise 3 - Mean Absolute Error
In class you learned about RNNs and LSTMs for prediction, as well as a simple methodology to pick a decent learning rate for the stochastic gradient descent optimizer. In this exercise youâ€™ll take a synthetic data set and write the code to pick the learning rate and then train on it to get an MAE of < 3

## Exercise 3 Answer - Mean Absolute Error
Let's take a look at the solution
