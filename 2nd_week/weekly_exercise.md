## Exercise 2 (Handwriting Recognition)

Now that you’ve worked through creating a basic computer vision scenario using TensorFlow to recognize fashion, you’re ready to do this weeks assignment -- and that is to build a neural network that recognizes handwriting digits! You’ve covered everything you need to succeed, so give it a try!

NOTE: Please do not modify any of the code already provided in the Exercise question, and please only add your additional code in the indicated areas marked by the comments. Once you have completed your notebook assignment and received a final score, please save your notebook, run the final cell, and close your Jupyter Workspace. This will help optimize your Jupyter workspace performance for future assessments. Please note that this step will shut down your kernel, so it is important to save your work in advance of completing this step

## Exercise 2 (Handwriting Recognition)

This is the same exercise and notebook as provided [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/notebook/FExZ4/exercise-2-handwriting-recognition). This button below will take you to the Google Colaboratory environment, in case you would like to use it to follow along with the course videos. In order to pass the graded item, you will still need to submit your work via the Coursera-hosted Jupyter Notebook.
