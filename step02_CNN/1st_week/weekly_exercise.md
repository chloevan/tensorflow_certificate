## Exercise 1 - Cats vs. Dogs
This week you explored a reduced version of the Cats v Dogs dataset and used it to train a convolutional neural network. You saw that it overfit very quickly, despite great results with the training set. One solution to overfitting is to use more data for both training and validation, and that’s this week’s exercise -- to build a classifier using the full Cats v Dogs dataset of 25k images!

Note again that when loading the images, you might get warnings about EXIF data being missing or corrupt. Don't worry about this -- it is missing data in the images, but it's not visual data that will impact the training.

Let's start building a classifier using the full Cats v Dogs dataset of 25k images.

NOTE: Please do not alter any of the provided code in the exercise. Only add your own code where indicated. Please do not add or remove any cells in the exercise. The grader will check specific cells based on the cell position. Please use the provided epoch values when training. Once you have completed your notebook assignment and received a final score, please save your notebook, run the final cell, and close your Jupyter Workspace. This will help optimize your Jupyter workspace performance for future assessments. Please note that this step will shut down your kernel, so it is important to save your work in advance of completing this step
