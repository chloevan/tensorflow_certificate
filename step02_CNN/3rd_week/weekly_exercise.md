## Exercise 3 - Horses vs. humans using Transfer Learning
This week your exercise will be to apply what you've learned about Transfer Learning to see if you can increase training accuracy for Horses v Humans. To avoid crazy overfitting, your validation set accuracy should be around 95% if you do it right!

Your training should automatically stop once it reaches this desired accuracy.

Let's now use Transfer Learning to increase the training accuracy for Horses v Humans!

NOTE: Please do not alter any of the provided code in the exercise. Only add your own code where indicated. Please do not add or remove any cells in the exercise. The grader will check specific cells based on the cell position. Please use the provided epoch values when training. Once you have completed your notebook assignment and received a final score, please save your notebook, run the final cell, and close your Jupyter Workspace. This will help optimize your Jupyter workspace performance for future assessments. Please note that this step will shut down your kernel, so it is important to save your work in advance of completing this step

## Exercise 3 - Horses vs. humans using Transfer Learning
This is the same exercise and notebook as provided [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/notebook/GpKYz/exercise-3-horses-vs-humans-using-transfer-learning). This button below will take you to the Google Colaboratory environment, in case you would like to use it to follow along with the course videos. In order to pass the graded item, you will still need to submit your work via the Coursera-hosted Jupyter Notebook.

This week your exercise will be to apply what you've learned about Transfer Learning to see if you can increase training accuracy for Horses v Humans to 99.9% or greater. To avoid crazy overfitting, your validation set accuracy should be around 95% if you do it right!

Your training should automatically stop once it reaches this desired accuracy, and it should do it in less than 100 epochs. Running on a colab GPU, I've been able to hit this metric in about 3 minutes and 69 epochs, and I'm sure with a bit of trial and error you could do much better!

For an increased challenge, see if you can get the validation set to 99% or above also! :)
