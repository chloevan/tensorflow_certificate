## Exercise 4 - Multi-class classifier
Now that you've explored the concepts behind going from binary classification to multi class classification, it's time for another Exercise. In this one you'll use the Sign Language dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist, and attempt to build a multi-class classifier to recognize sign language!

Let's build a multi-class classifier to recognize sign language!

NOTE: Please do not alter any of the provided code in the exercise. Only add your own code where indicated. Please do not add or remove any cells in the exercise. The grader will check specific cells based on the cell position. Please use the provided epoch values when training. Once you have completed your notebook assignment and received a final score, please save your notebook, run the final cell, and close your Jupyter Workspace. This will help optimize your Jupyter workspace performance for future assessments. Please note that this step will shut down your kernel, so it is important to save your work in advance of completing this step

## Exercise 4 - Multi-class classifier
This is the same exercise and notebook as provided here. This button below will take you to the Google Colaboratory environment, in case you would like to use it to follow along with the course videos. In order to pass the graded item, you will still need to submit your work via the Coursera-hosted Jupyter Notebook.
